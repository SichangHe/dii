## Project Background

China is lacking high-quality knowledge interchange platforms.
As a student, Steven usually fails to find answers to his questions
if he searches on Baidu or China Bing.
In contrast, he usually succeeds if he searches on Google.
The results Baidu usually show are from Chinese sites such as
Baidu Zhidao, Zhihu, CSDN, and other smaller sites,
but the results Google usually show are from international sites such as
Stack Exchange, Reddit, or some blog sites.
The former ones of the above sites usually contain low-quality content
compared to the latter ones.
They usually consists of answers that does not answer the questions,
or answers that are merely copied from somewhere else on the internet.
Many of such answers can be categorized as spams.
Also, these sites are usually filled with Ads,
some of them require a fee to view the content,
which makes them inaccessible.

A project by CUHK-Shenzhen was published in summer 2022,
at www.qiusuozhilu.com.
Steven has in contact with the project founder since its beginning.
The project has received some success,
but its biggest problem is that it does not allow effective knowledge interchange,
that is, it only supports posting content but it does not allow rich conversations.
