# Presenting FoRum, the open forum

## Product and Service

- Is the solution feasible and realistic?

### The Problem

China is lacking high-quality knowledge interchange platforms.

### How does FoRum solve The Problem

Observe that,
to have high-quality knowledge interchange on a platform,
we need:

- Users who have high-quality knowledge and are willing to interchange it.
- A platform that helps users interchange information.

Examples include Reddit and Stack Overflow.

Speculate that,
the reason why China is lacking high-quality knowledge interchange platforms:

- Many users with high-quality knowledge are not willing to interchange it.
- FoRum's competitors do not support high-quality knowledge interchange well.
    - Ad and spammer farm such as
        [Baidu Zhidao](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/1311735874485709379.html).
    - Lack of proper commenting, upvote, and categorizing mechanisms,
        such as [Jianshu](https://www.jianshu.com/p/3ef5e96c7669).
